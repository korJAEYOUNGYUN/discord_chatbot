For communicating with discord and dialogflow, you need to do the following steps.

- [Create a discord application as a bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro)
- [Create a google project to use dialogflow api](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/quick/setup)

The behavior and performance of your bot depends on the agent of your dialogflow.
